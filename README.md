# Lord of the Rings Trivia!

The game can be found here! [Game](https://tomkc518.github.io/trivia_game/)

This game was all about dynamically updating the page with Javascript using jQuery and Bootstrap 4.

Once the start button is pressed the first question starts.

Once answered it goes to the answer screen.

This repeats until the questions are done, and the score screen is shown.

A reset button appears and allows you to start all over again!

The main take away from this game was using setInterval()

This game also helped me with scope and functions.
